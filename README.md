# 3 little tasks

Here are three sample python code I did when I was taking Logic and Computation.

Q3.py generates a pair(n,m)of random integers of several thousand digits and applies the extended Euclid algorithm to find their greatest common divisor d as well as a pair (a, b) of integers such that an + bm = d

Q5.py quickly generates an integer of several thousand digits which is probably prime, using Fermatâ€™s Pri- mality Test.

Q6.py decrypt an RSA key and an encrypted message
