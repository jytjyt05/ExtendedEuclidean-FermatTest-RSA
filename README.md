# Extended Euclid algorithm and RSA decryption&encryption

Here are three sample python code:

- **Extended Euclidean.py** generates a pair(n,m)of random integers of several thousand digits and applies the extended Euclid algorithm to find their greatest common divisor d as well as a pair (a, b) of integers such that an + bm = d

- **FermatTest.py** quickly generates an integer of several thousand digits which is probably prime, using Fermatâ€™s Pri- mality Test.

- **RSA.py** decrypt an RSA key and an encrypted message
